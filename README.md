# How to survive Git

This repo demonstrates the git commands that you can use to change the git history. You might need to do that when you
  
  - have accidentally commited and pushed changes that leave security concerns. For example, you accidently added the file that contain credentials to the commit. 
  - want to squash the commits to make it more readable for other developers.
  - need to have the latest master branch and preserve all the changes on your local branch.

## How to use this repo

This repo contains examples that use git commands to fix the situations described above. Just do `git clone <this-repo-name> ` and navigate to the repo in the terminal, where you can start executing the scripts to see the changes by doing `source <script-name>`. You can copy and paste the code line by line if unsure, but you shouldn't need to do so because the purpose and the expected result of each command are logged to the terminal during execution.
